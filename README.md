# -PARALLEL-LINKED-QUADRUPED-ROBOT
A legged robot using an ESP32 with PWM to control the servo motors, and use an ESP32 web server over Wi-Fi for remote control.

## Introduction ##
The legged robots are more complex in design and control, but they are stronger in holonomic motion ability, manoeuvring, and application variety.
This project involves creating a quadruped robot using ESP32 Microcontroller and PWM to drive all the 12 servo motors, all components being 3D printed in-house and Controlled by ESP32 Web Server.
