# -PARALLEL-LINKED-QUADRUPED-ROBOT
A legged robot using an ESP32 with PWM to control the servo motors, and use an ESP32 web server over Wi-Fi for remote control.

## Introduction ##
The legged robots are more complex in design and control, but they are stronger in holonomic motion ability, manoeuvring, and application variety.

This project involves creating a quadruped robot using ESP32 Microcontroller and PWM to drive all the 12 servo motors, all components being 3D printed in-house and Controlled by ESP32 Web Server.

## Components 
1) ESP32  <br/>
2) PWM  <br/>
3) Servo Motors  X12   <br/>
4) Buck Converter
5) Li-Ion Battery  X3
6) Battery Holder
7) Flange Bearing X20
8) Flat Bearing X10
