# -PARALLEL-LINKED-QUADRUPED-ROBOT
A legged robot using an ESP32 with PWM to control the servo motors, and use an ESP32 web server over Wi-Fi for remote control.

## Introduction ##
The legged robots are more complex in design and control, but they are stronger in holonomic motion ability, manoeuvring, and application variety.

Creating a 3D-printed quadruped robot with 12 PWM-driven servo motors, controlled by an ESP32 web server.

## Components 
1) ESP32  <br/>
2) PWM  <br/>
3) Servo Motors  X12   <br/>
4) Buck Converter
5) Li-Ion Battery  X3
6) Battery Holder
7) Flange Bearing X20
8) Flat Bearing X10
## Assembly
We 3D printed all the frames using a Snapmaker, based on the provided CAD file. The base plate is an acrylic sheet that was laser-cut.

Flange and flat bearings are used between the links to reduce friction, allowing for the free movement of the robot's legs.
